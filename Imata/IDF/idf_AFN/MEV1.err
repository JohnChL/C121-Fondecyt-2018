   ** Warning ** Site:GroundTemperature:BuildingSurface: Some values fall outside the range of 15-25C.
   **   ~~~   ** These values may be inappropriate.  Please consult the Input Output Reference for more details.
   ** Warning ** GetAirflowNetworkInput: SurfaceAverageCalculation is entered for field = Wind Pressure Coefficient Type, but no roof surface is defined using an AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surface object.
   **   ~~~   ** Reconsider if this is your modeling intent. Simulation continues.
   ** Warning ** GetAirflowNetworkInput: SurfaceAverageCalculation is entered for field = Wind Pressure Coefficient Type.
   **   ~~~   ** The AirflowNetwork model provides wind pressure coefficients for 4 vertical exterior orientations and 1 horizontal roof.
   **   ~~~   **  There are only 0 exterior surface orientations defined in this input file using AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surface objects.
   **   ~~~   ** Reconsider if this is your modeling intent. Simulation continues.
   ** Warning ** An AirflowNetwork:Multizone:Surface object has an air-flow opening corresponding to
   **   ~~~   ** window or door = CLARAB MOD, which is within 
   **   ~~~   ** 10 deg of being horizontal. Airflows through large horizontal openings are poorly
   **   ~~~   ** modeled in the AirflowNetwork model resulting in only one-way airflow.
   ** Warning ** An AirflowNetwork:Multizone:Surface object has an air-flow opening corresponding to
   **   ~~~   ** window or door = CLARAB FT ATICO, which is within 
   **   ~~~   ** 10 deg of being horizontal. Airflows through large horizontal openings are poorly
   **   ~~~   ** modeled in the AirflowNetwork model resulting in only one-way airflow.
