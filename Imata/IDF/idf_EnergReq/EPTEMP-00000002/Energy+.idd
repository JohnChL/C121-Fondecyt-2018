! **************************************************************************
! This file is the Input Data Dictionary (IDD) for EnergyPlus.
! The IDD defines the syntax and data model for each type of input "Object."
! Lines in EnergyPlus input files (and IDD) are limited to 500 characters.
!
! Object Description
! ------------------
! To define an object (a record with data), develop a key word that is unique
! Each data item to the object can be A (Alphanumeric string) or N (numeric)
! Number each A and N.  This will show how the data items will be put into the
! arrays that are passed to the Input Processor "Get" (GetObjectItem) routines.
! All alpha fields are limited to 100 characters.  Numeric fields should be
! valid numerics (can include such as 1.0E+05) and are placed into double
! precision variables.
!
! NOTE: Even though a field may be optional, a comma representing that field
!   must be included (unless it is the last field in the object).  Since the
!   entire input is "field-oriented" and not "keyword-oriented", the EnergyPlus
!   Input Processor must have some representation (even if blank) for each
!   field.
!
! Object Documentation
! --------------------
! In addition, the following special comments appear one per line and
! most are followed by a value.  Comments may apply to a field or the object
! or a group of objects.
!
! Field-level comments:
!
!  \field           Name of field
!                     (should be succinct and readable, blanks are encouraged)
!
!  \note            Note describing the field and its valid values. If multiple lines,
!                   start each line with \note. Limit line length to 100 characters.
!
!  \required-field  To flag fields which must have a value. If the idf input is blank and
!                   there is a \default, then the default will be used. However, as of v8.6.0
!                   the use of \required-field and \default on the same field is discouraged
!                   and instances with both have been changed.
!                     (this comment has no "value")
!
!  \begin-extensible  Marks the first field at which the object accepts an extensible
!                   field set.  A fixed number of fields from this marker define the
!                   extensible field set, see the object code \extensible for
!                   more information.
!
!  \units           Units (must be from EnergyPlus standard units list)
!                   EnergyPlus units are standard SI units
!
!  \ip-units        IP-Units (for use by input processors with IP units)
!                   This is only used if the default conversion is not
!                   appropriate.
!
!  \unitsBasedOnField  For fields that may have multiple possible units, indicates
!                   the field in the object that can be used to determine
!                   the units. The field reference is in the A2 form.
!
!  \minimum         Minimum that includes the following value
!
!  \minimum>        Minimum that must be > than the following value
!
!  \maximum         Maximum that includes the following value
!
!  \maximum<        Maximum that must be < than the following value
!
!  \default         Default for the field (if N/A then omit entire line). If a default is
!                   added to an existing field, then \required-field should be removed if present.
!                   Defaults are filled in only if the field is within \min-fields, or the actual
!                   object is longer than this field.
!
!  \deprecated      This field is not really used and will be deleted from the object.
!                   The required information is gotten internally or
!                   not needed by the program.
!
!  \autosizable     Flag to indicate that this field can be used with the Auto
!                   Sizing routines to produce calculated results for the
!                   field.  If a value follows this, then that will be used
!                   when the "Autosize" feature is flagged.  To trigger
!                   autosizing for a field, enter Autosize as the field's
!                   value.  Only applicable to numeric fields.
!
!  \autocalculatable Flag to indicate that this field can be automatically
!                   calculated. To trigger auto calculation for a field, enter
!                   Autocalculate as the field's value.  Only applicable to
!                   numeric fields.
!
!  \type            Type of data for the field -
!                     integer
!                     real
!                     alpha       (arbitrary string),
!                     choice      (alpha with specific list of choices, see
!                                 \key)
!                     object-list (link to a list of objects defined elsewhere,
!                                  see \object-list and \reference)
!                     external-list (uses a special list from an external source,
!                                    see \external-list)
!                     node        (name used in connecting HVAC components)
!
!  \retaincase      Retains the alphabetic case for alpha type fields
!
!  \key             Possible value for "\type choice" (blanks are significant)
!                     use multiple \key lines to indicate all valid choices
!
!  \object-list     Name of a list of user-provided object names that are valid
!                     entries for this field (used with "\reference")
!                     see Zone and BuildingSurface:Detailed objects below for
!                     examples.
!                  ** Note that a field may have multiple \object-list commands.
!
!  \external-list   The values for this field should be selected from a special
!                   list generated outside of the IDD file. The choices for the
!                   special lists are:
!                        autoRDDvariable
!                        autoRDDmeter
!                        autoRDDvariableMeter
!                   When one of these are selected the options for the field
!                   are taken from the RDD or MDD file or both.
!
!  \reference       Name of a list of names to which this object belongs
!                     used with "\type object-list" and with "\object-list"
!                     see Zone and BuildingSurface:Detailed objects below for
!                     examples:
!
!                        Zone,
!                          A1 , \field Name
!                               \type alpha
!                               \reference ZoneNames
!
!                        BuildingSurface:Detailed,
!                          A4 , \field Zone Name
!                               \note Zone the surface is a part of
!                               \type object-list
!                               \object-list ZoneNames
!
!             For each zone, the field "Name" may be referenced
!             by other objects, such as BuildingSurface:Detailed, so it is
!             commented with "\reference ZoneNames"
!             Fields that reference a zone name, such as BuildingSurface:Detailed's
!             "Zone Name", are commented as
!             "\type object-list" and "\object-list ZoneNames"
!             ** Note that a field may have multiple \reference commands.
!             ** This is useful if the object belongs to a small specific
!             object-list as well as a larger more general object-list.

!
!  \min-fields      Minimum number of fields that should be included in the
!                   object.  If appropriate, the Input Processor will fill
!                   any missing fields with defaults (for numeric fields).
!                   It will also supply that number of fields to the "get"
!                   routines using blanks for alpha fields (note -- blanks
!                   may not be allowable for some alpha fields).

!                   The options include SingleLine, Vertices, CompactSchedule,
!                   FluidProperties, ViewFactors, and Spectral.
!                   The SingleLine option puts all the fields for the object
!                   on a single line. The Vertices option is used in objects
!                   that use X, Y and Z fields to format those three fields
!                   on a single line.

       \note vertices are given in GlobalGeometryRules coordinates -- if relative, all surface coordinates
       \note are "relative" to the Zone Origin.  If world, then building and zone origins are used
       \note for some internal calculations, but all coordinates are given in an "absolute" system.

       \memo   same elevation but have different air temperatures.  In this case, the mixing air flow
       \memo   between the two zones is determined by the density difference between the two zones.
       \memo   This would typically be used between two zones in a refrigerated warehouse that are
       \memo   controlled at different temperatures.  It could also be used to model a door to a walk-in

       \memo For example, with a dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS), the air terminal for the DOAS
       \memo should be assigned Heating Sequence = 1 and Cooling Sequence = 1.  Any other equipment should
       \memo be assigned sequence 2 or higher so that it will see the net load after the DOAS air is added
